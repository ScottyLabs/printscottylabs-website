      <h3>PRINT</h3>
      <p>
        To print a document, send it as an attachment to <a href="mailto:print@scottylabs.org">print@scottylabs.org</a> from your
        @andrew.cmu.edu email account (or another account you have linked;
        see below).  Currently, PDFs and plain text documents are supported. Other
        formats might work too, but are not guaranteed.
      </p>

      <h3>LINK</h3>
      <p>
        To configure your account with <a href="mailto:print@scottylabs.org">print@scottylabs.org</a>, send an email with
        "CONFIGURE" in the subject line (in all caps). In the message body, put
        one of the following commands on each line:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "LINK new_address@example.com" - starts the process to link an
           email address that we don't know about to the one you're sending
           from. Note that you'll have to confirm that the new address is yours
           before you can use it.
        </li>
        <li>
          "UNLINK some_address@example.com" - starts the process of unlinking an
          email address from your account. Note that you can't unlink your
          andrew account from its own print queue.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>HELP</h3>
      <p>
        To get help, send an email to print@scottylabs.org with
        "HELP" in the subject line (in all caps).
